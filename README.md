Image Editing App

This is a demo project to edit image using a custom view. We can select image from gallery as well as from camera and edit the image as per the requirement. To render this we have created custom class that extends Relative Layout to view selected image and apply filters on it. Used Open GL ES 2 to draw on surface.
This demo contains following edits:

- Add text to the Image selected
- Draw using different colored brush
- Erase mistakenly edited filter
- Apply filters like:	
	- Autofix
	- Brightness
	- Contrast
	- Documentary
	- Due tone
	- Fill Light
	- Fish eye
	- Grain
	- Gray scale
	- Lomish
	- Negative
	- Posterize
	- Saturate
	- Sepia
	- Sharpen
	- Temparature
	- Tint
	- Vignette
	- Cross Process
	- Black and White
	- Flip Horizontal
	- Flip Vertical
	- Rotate
- Add Emoticons

After applying filters we can save the image in our gallery directly.
